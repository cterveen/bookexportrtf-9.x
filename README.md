# bookexportrtf-9.x

A port of the bookrtf-7.x module to Drupal 9.x.

Book Export RTF exports a book or book-page to an RTF format.

The current version is something that 'works' and mainly archived for my myself. It's not up to the Drupal standards (or any other standards) and has a lot of ugly code. Use it at your own risk, please do not upload to arctic vaults.
