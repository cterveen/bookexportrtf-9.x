## Project title
bookexport-rtf-9.x

## Description

bookexport-rtf-9.x is a Drupal 9 module that exports a Drupal book or book page to RTF format. The module was build first for Drupal 7 to export books to something printable and readable as the printer friendly version isn't really reader friendly. The module exports a book page and its subpages to an RTF document and adds elements suchs as a front page, table of contents, page numbers, chapter references etc. The module integrates with bookindex-9.x to add a page referenced index. A link to download the document is added to the bottom of the page. The size of the document and lay-out is customizable through CSS.

The base language of the module is English. Internationalisation and localisation are supported. A Dutch translation of the interface and book parts generated by the module is included. Timestamps generated by the module are formatted according to the Drupal 'long' format. The lay-out of the document can be configured through css. A help text is available. Options are not available. The module is not in the Drupal module repository.

The project can be considered beta. The module is not in use but worked in a Drupal 9.x and Drupal 11.x (with Book 1.x) test environment. The coding has been updated to Drupal 9.x coding standards and includes testing. The RTF document was tested in Microsoft Word and Libreoffice Writer. The module is under active maintainance.

## Installation
Depends on the Drupal [Book](https://www.drupal.org/project/book) module which was part of Drupal Core until Drupal 10.x and is a separate module in Drupal 11.

Download [Simple HTML DOM](https://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.io/) and copy parser.php into /libraries/simple_html_dom/

Download [Schepp's CSS Parser](https://github.com/Schepp/CSS-Parser) and copy simple_html_dom.php into /libraries/schepp-css-parser/

Copy all the files into /modules/bookexportrtf/

Enable the module

## Use

The RTF document can be accessed through the url (/book/exportrtf/\[node-id\]). A link to download the book or book page as RTF is available on every book page next to the printer friendly link.

## Configuration

The lay-out of the document can be changed by adding a bookexportrtf.rtf.css to the themes css directory.

Translations can be added to the translations directory as .po files.

See the help page (/admin/help/bookexportrtf) for details.

## Testing

Functional tests are available and can be tested from a development installation with the following command run from core: `../vendor/bin/phpunit ../modules/bookexportrtf/tests/src/Functional/bookexportrtfTest.php`

One risky result is given as testing conversion of the main document is disabled, presumably due to issues with the time formatting.
